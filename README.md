Add the PLCComm Library , then run the API.  Has a GetTags API call, but it takes while to parse through all the tags in the PLC, so what I did was I added a Postgres database table (using Docker) to store all the tags that are collected from the PLC. Then, you can use the GetStoredTags API to get them from the table instead.  That way we're not calling the GetTags API as often. If you know that the PLC's tags have changed, then just run the GetTags again.
